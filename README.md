# ETG-INVENTORY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

### Hello All !!!! 

## I made a project on "INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM" using PYTHON JSON.

This repository is having all the codes with json files for making an Inventory Management System during "ELITE TECHNO GROUPS" AI/ML Internship.
### I"ve made an INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM which is working on NoSQL based database :

Inventory Management System is a System in which the Products of the Inventory are updated automatically when a user purcahses some item from the inventory or when the user adds new products to the Inventory.This system helps the owner to keep the track on all the stock he is having in his inventory. IMS is used mostly at all shops,malls and businesses.

### I have added many more functionalities to this Project as follows :
--> New Items can be added.

--> Purchase of items can be done.

--> Whole Inventory Items can be viewed.

--> Bill can be printed.

--> Inventory is updated automatically when no. of products are added or purchased.

--> The record of each Customer who has purchased the items is noted with Date and Time in seperate file.

--> Total no. of Product categories can be viewed.

--> We can know the Amount of total stock we have in the Inventory.

--> Item from Inventory can be Deleted.

### DESCRIPTION OF MY PROJECT :


# So,Firstly In "Code_To_Create_Record_Json_File.ipynb" file ,

I created 50 Products in the Dictionery named "record".

### I added 7 attributes to the "record.json" file :

{"Product_Id", "Product_Name", "Product_Category", "Total_Units", "Price_per_unit", "Total_Amount", "Expiry Date"}.

And using the Properties of File Handling I created "record.json" file.All 50 Products are saved in "original_record.json" file.

# Then,In "Code_for_Adding_New_Products_To_Inventory" file ,

I firstly loaded the "record.json" file.Then using If-Else Conditions and properties of Dictionery I wrote a code to add new items in the Inventory such that if we add new item,all the details of that new item must automatically be updated in "record.json" file. Or even if we update the existing product the details of that product must be updated automatically in "record.json" file.

# Lastly,In "Code_to_Purchase_Product_from_Inventory" file , 

I firstly wrote the code such that Customer can View whole Inventory,Purchase Product From Inventory,Delete the item from Inventory and Print Bill.And after doing this the Inventory is Updated Automatically.

Then,I created a "sales.json" file , In which all the names of the Customers who purchased the Product is updated automatically with the details of the Product they purchased and at what Date & Time they purchased the product.

### I added 9 attributes to the "sales.json" file :


{"Customer Id", "Customer Name", "Product Id", "Product Name", "Product Category", "Price Per Unit", "No of Quantity", "Billing Amount", "Time and Date"}


### In this way I created "INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM" Project.


### Happy to share my First Repository on GitHub!!!!


### Hope you all like my Project:-)
